Collection of dotfiles which I've cultivated over time..

For starters, I use screen quite a lot for my session management so you can refer to the screenrc file for the customizations I use.

Particular good features I used were:
	* The use of the back tick for the escape sequence key. The back tick key is more intuitive
	  as I'm also an avid vim user. (Good bye CTRL + A!)
	* Key bindings of F11 and F12 to switch left and right respectively between screens
	* The hard status line at the bottom gives a good idea of which tab we are on and which shell it uses
	* All the other screen specific commands, as CTRL + A + S to split screen are now reduced to `S and so on.
